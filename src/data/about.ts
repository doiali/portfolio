export const about_intro = `
Hi, I'm Alireza Bagheri! A curious engineer with 5 years of experience as a Frontend Developer specialized in Typescript and React.  
I started programming during my mechanical engineering studies. I got super excited whenever I had to code for robotics or microcontroller projects. So for my master’s degree, I studied Mechatronics Engineering to be further engaged with programming. After finishing school, I decided to become a web developer out of curiosity about the web and the internet! It’s one of the most exciting technologies and we are lucky to live in this era!  
Now after 5 years of experience in frontend development (and 2 years of trying backend development with python). I still see a long way to go, exciting projects to build and wonderful emerging technologies to learn and adapt.

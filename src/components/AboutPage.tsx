          Hi, I&apos;m Alireza Bagheri, 29 years old with over 4 years of experience as a Senior Frontend Developer. I specialize in ReactJS and Next.js.<br />
          I started programming during my mechanical engineering studies because I really liked it. For my masterâ€™s degree, I studied Mechatronics Engineering and worked on flying robots. After finishing school, I decided to become a web developer because I found it very interesting. <br />
          Today, I am proud of the great projects I have worked on. I am excited to keep working as a developer, make fast and beautiful applications, and learn more new things along the way.
        </p>
